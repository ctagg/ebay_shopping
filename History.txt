March 2

* Jan 20
	* Raise TimeoutError when ebay internal timeout error (Error code 1.23)

* January 13
	* Changed instance variable used in FindProductsResponse#products to @products

* January 12, 2008
	* Added support for FindProducts call
	* Added GenericItem class from which Item class and new Product class inherit

* January 11, 2008
	* Tweaked error handling so ebay's error response is passed to ebay_error_raised hook
	* Made Request#check_error_cache a protected method
	* Changed ebay API version to 547
	* Cached error checking now done before checking for cached response
	* Changed name of cached_response to cached_xml_response. cached_response is better name for a public method, which might return Response object, if there's a cached_xml_response, nil otherwise. Allows loading of pages to be speeded up, with queries perhaps being triggered on demand (and then cached) or by js
